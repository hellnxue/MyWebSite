    <div class="inner">Who Moved My Cheese? is an amusing and enlightening story of four characters who live in a maze and look for cheese to nourish them and make them happy. Cheese is a metaphor for what you want to have in life - whether it is a good job, a loving relationship, money or a possession, health or spirital peace of mind.And the maze is where you look for what you want - the organisation you work in, or the family or community you live in.</div>
