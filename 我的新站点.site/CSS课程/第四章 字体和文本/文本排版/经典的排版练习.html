	<h2>an excerpt from</h2>
	
	<h1>The Hound of the Baskervilles</h1>
	
	<p>Holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it upon
	his knee. &ldquo;You will observe, Watson, the alternative use of the
	long s and the short. It is one of several indications which enabled me
	to fix the date.&rdquo; At the head was written: &ldquo;;Baskerville
	Hall,&rdquo; and below in large, scrawling figures: &ldquo;;1742.&rdquo;</p>
	
	<p>&ldquo;;It appears to be a statement of some sort.&rdquo;</p>
	
	<p>&ldquo;;Yes&mdash;it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the
	Baskerville family.&rdquo;</p>
	
	<blockquote>
	
		<q>Of the origin of the Hound of the Baskervilles there have been many
		statements, yet as I come in a direct line from Hugo Baskerville, and
		as I had the story from my father&hellip;</q>
	
	</blockquote>
	
	<p>When Dr. Mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he pushed
	his spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at Mr. Sherlock
	Holmes.</p>
